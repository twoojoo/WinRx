# WinRx - A Windowing System for RXJS

By introducing new operators, **WinRx** allows you to extend RXJS' windowing capablities to make it able to process windows of data from a stream in a more customized way. Intstead of processing data from a stream one by one, you can process a window of array-collected data extracted from a stream according to the window type, while persisting data in a custom storage.
